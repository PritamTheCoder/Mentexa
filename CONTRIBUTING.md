 # Contributing to Mentexa

Thank you for your interest in contributing to "Mentexa" — a mental health self-check portal developed by Group A8 as part of our BCSIT project under Pokhara University.

## Contributors

This project is currently being maintained and developed by the original project group:

- Pritam Thapa (Lead Developer & Designer)
- Avash Mainali
- Isha Shrestha

##  Scope of Contribution

As of now, all contributions and updates are managed by the core team members listed above. This repository is part of our academic coursework, and external contributions are not accepted at this stage.

##  Internal Guidelines

Group members should follow these basic contribution practices:

1. Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
2. Work on a separate branch for new features.
3. Test all changes locally before pushing.
4. Keep code clean, commented, and modular.
5. Make sure the UI remains fully responsive.

##  Folder Naming Conventions

- HTML files go in the root or `pages/` folder.
- (Use internal css and javaScript)
- Custom CSS goes in `css/`
- JavaScript logic (if modular) goes in `js/`
- Assets like images or illustrations go in `images/`

##  Future Development

Future features (optional):
- Mood tracking using local storage
- Psychiatrist appointment and reference
- Journaling functionality
- Improved dashboard navigation

For any major changes or discussions, group members are encouraged to collaborate through our shared communication channel or version control platform.
